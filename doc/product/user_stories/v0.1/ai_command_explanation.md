## User Story: AI-Powered Git Command Explanation

As a Git user, especially one who is learning new commands or less common options,
I want to be able to invoke `gitie` with an `--ai` flag followed by a Git command that includes its own help flag (e.g., `gitie --ai status --short --help`),
So that I can receive a clear, AI-generated explanation of what that specific Git command and its options do, helping me understand it better directly in my terminal instead of just seeing the standard Git help text.
